<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-1may-2sept-1">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 1—May 2—Sept. 1</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Listen, my son, to your master’s precepts, and incline the ear of your heart. Receive willingly and carry out effectively your loving father’s advice, that by the labor of obedience you may return to Him from whom you had departed by the sloth of disobedience.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To you, therefore, my words are now addressed, whoever you may be, who are renouncing your own will to do battle under the Lord Christ, the true King, and are taking up the strong, bright weapons of obedience.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And first of all, whatever good work you begin to do, beg of Him with most earnest prayer to perfect it, that He who has now deigned to count us among His sons may not at any time be grieved by our evil deeds. For we must always so serve Him with the good things He has given us, that He will never as an angry Father disinherit His children, nor ever as a dread Lord, provoked by our evil actions, deliver us to everlasting punishment as wicked servants who would not follow Him to glory.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-2may-3sept-2">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" id="page-2" title="2"> </span><span>Jan. 2—May 3—Sept. 2</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Let us arise, then, at last, for the Scripture stirs us up, saying, “Now is the hour for us to rise from sleep.” Let us open our eyes to the deifying light, let us hear with attentive ears the warning which the divine voice cries daily to us, “Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts.” And again, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” And what does He say? “Come, My children, listen to Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Run while you have the light of life, lest the darkness of death overtake you.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-3may-4sept-3">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 3—May 4—Sept. 3</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>And the Lord, seeking His laborer in the multitude to whom He thus cries out, says again, “Who is the man who will have life, and desires to see good days?” And if, hearing Him, you answer, “I am he,” God says to you, “If you will have true and everlasting life, keep your tongue from evil and your lips that they speak no guile. Turn away from evil and do good; seek after peace and pursue it. And when you have done these things, My eyes shall be upon you and My ears open to your prayers; and before you call upon Me, I will say to you, ‘Behold, here I am.’”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What can be sweeter to us, dear brethren, than this voice of the Lord inviting us? Behold, </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-3" title="3"> </span><span>in His loving kindness the Lord shows us the way of life.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-4may-5sept-4">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 4—May 5—Sept. 4</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Having our loins girded, therefore, with faith and the performance of good works, let us walk in His paths by the guidance of the Gospel, that we may deserve to see Him who has called us to His kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For if we wish to dwell in the tent of that kingdom, we must run to it by good deeds or we shall never reach it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But let us ask the Lord, with the Prophet, “Lord, who shall dwell in Your tent, or who shall rest upon Your holy mountain?”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After this question, brethren, let us listen to the Lord as He answers and shows us the way to that tent, saying, “He who walks without stain and practices justice; he who speaks truth from his heart; he who has not used his tongue for deceit; he who has done no evil to his neighbor; he who has given no place to slander against his neighbor.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is he who, under any temptation from the malicious devil, has brought him to naught by casting him and his temptation from the sight of his heart; and who has laid hold of his thoughts while they were still young and dashed them against Christ.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is they who, fearing the Lord, do not pride themselves on their good observance; </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-4" title="4"> </span><span>but, convinced that the good which is in them cannot come from themselves and must be from the Lord, glorify the Lord’s work in them, using the words of the Prophet, “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give the glory.” Thus also the Apostle Paul attributed nothing of the success of his preaching to himself, but said, “By the grace of God I am what I am.” And again he says, “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-5may-6sept-5">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 5—May 6—Sept. 5</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Hence the Lord says in the Gospel, “Whoever listens to these words of Mine and acts upon them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on rock. The floods came, the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not fall, because it was founded on rock.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Having given us these assurances, the Lord is waiting every day for us to respond by our deeds to His holy admonitions. And the days of this life are lengthened and a truce granted us for this very reason, that we may amend our evil ways. As the Apostle says, “Do you not know that God’s patience is inviting you to repent?” For the merciful Lord tells us, “I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he should be converted and live.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-6may-7sept-6">

<p class="pfirst"><span>So, brethren, we have asked the Lord who is to dwell in His tent, and we have heard His commands to anyone who would dwell there; it remains for us to fulfil those duties.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Therefore we must prepare our hearts and our bodies to do battle under the holy obedience of His commands; and let us ask God that He be pleased to give us the help of His grace for anything which our nature finds hardly possible. And if we want to escape the pains of hell and attain life everlasting, then, while there is still time, while we are still in the body and are able to fulfil all these things by the light of this life, we must hasten to do now what will profit us for eternity.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>And so we are going to establish a school for the service of the Lord. In founding it we hope to introduce nothing harsh or burdensome. But if a certain strictness results from the dictates of equity for the amendment of vices or the preservation of charity, do not be at once dismayed and fly from the way of salvation, whose entrance cannot but be narrow. For as we advance in the religious life and in faith, our hearts expand and we run the way of God’s commandments with unspeakable sweetness of love. Thus, never departing </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-6" title="6"> </span><span>from His school, but persevering in the monastery according to His teaching until death, we may by patience share in the sufferings of Christ and deserve to have a share also in His kingdom.</span></p>

<h2 class="center level-2 no-bold pfirst section-title title with-subtitle"><span>CHAPTER 1</span><span>
<br /></span><span>On the Kinds of Monks</span></h2>
<p class="level-2 pfirst section-subtitle subtitle" id="jan-8may-9sept-8">
<span>Jan. 8—May 9—Sept. 8</span></p>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It is well known that there are four kinds of monks. The first kind are the Cenobites: those who live in monasteries and serve under a rule and an Abbot.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The second kind are the Anchorites or Hermits: those who, no longer in the first fervor of their reformation, but after long probation in a monastery, having learned by the help of many brethren how to fight against the devil, go out well armed from the ranks of the community to the solitary combat of the desert. They are able now, with no help save from God, to fight single-handed against the vices of the flesh and their own evil thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The third kind of monks, a detestable kind, are the Sarabaites. These, not having been tested, as gold in the furnace, by any rule or by the lessons of experience, are as soft as lead. In their works they still keep faith with the world, so that their tonsure marks them as liars before God. They live in twos or threes, or even singly, without a shepherd, </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-7" title="7"> </span><span>in their own sheepfolds and not in the Lord’s. Their law is the desire for self-gratification: whatever enters their mind or appeals to them, that they call holy; what they dislike, they regard as unlawful.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The fourth kind of monks are those called Gyrovagues. These spend their whole lives tramping from province to province, staying as guests in different monasteries for three or four days at a time. Always on the move, with no stability, they indulge their own wills and succumb to the allurements of gluttony, and are in every way worse than the Sarabaites. Of the miserable conduct of all such men it is better to be silent than to speak.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Passing these over, therefore, let us proceed, with God’s help, to lay down a rule for the strongest kind of monks, the Cenobites.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-2-nl-what-kind-of-man-the-abbot-ought-to-be">
<h2 class="center level-2 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER 2</span><span>
<br /></span><span>What Kind of Man the Abbot Ought to Be</span></h2>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-9may-10sept-9">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 9—May 10—Sept. 9</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>An Abbot who is worthy to be over a monastery should always remember what he is called, and live up to the name of Superior. For he is believed to hold the place of Christ in the monastery, being called by a name of His, which is taken from the words of the Apostle: “You have received a Spirit of </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-8" title="8"> </span><span>adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry, ‘Abba—Father!’”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Therefore the Abbot ought not to teach or ordain or command anything which is against the Lord’s precepts; on the contrary, his commands and his teaching should be a leaven of divine justice kneaded into the minds of his disciples.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-10may-11sept-10">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 10—May 11—Sept. 10</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Let the Abbot always bear in mind that at the dread Judgment of God there will be an examination of these two matters: his teaching and the obedience of his disciples. And let the Abbot be sure that any lack of profit the master of the house may find in the sheep will be laid to the blame of the shepherd. On the other hand, if the shepherd has bestowed all his pastoral diligence on a restless, unruly flock and tried every remedy for their unhealthy behavior, then he will be acquitted at the Lord’s Judgment and may say to the Lord with the Prophet: “I have not concealed Your justice within my heart; Your truth and Your salvation I have declared. But they have despised and rejected me.” And then finally let death itself, irresistible, punish those disobedient sheep under his charge.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-11may-12sept-11">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 11—May 12—Sept. 11</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Therefore, when anyone receives the name </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-9" title="9"> </span><span>of Abbot, he ought to govern his disciples with a twofold teaching. That is to say, he should show them all that is good and holy by his deeds even more than by his words, expounding the Lord’s commandments in words to the intelligent among his disciples, but demonstrating the divine precepts by his actions for those of harder hearts and ruder minds. And whatever he has taught his disciples to be contrary to God’s law, let him indicate by his example that it is not to be done, lest, while preaching to others, he himself be found reprobate, and lest God one day say to him in his sin, “Why do you declare My statutes and profess My covenant with your lips, whereas you hate discipline and have cast My words behind you?” And again, “You were looking at the speck in your brother’s eye, and did not see the beam in your own.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-12may-13sept-12">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 12—May 13—Sept. 12</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Let him make no distinction of persons in the monastery. Let him not love one more than another, unless it be one whom he finds better in good works or in obedience. Let him not advance one of noble birth ahead of one who was formerly a slave, unless there be some other reasonable ground for it. But if the Abbot for just reason think fit to do so, let him advance one of any rank whatever. </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-10" title="10"> </span><span>Otherwise let them keep their due places; because, whether slaves or freemen, we are all one in Christ and bear an equal burden of service in the army of the same Lord. For with God there is no respect of persons. Only for one reason are we preferred in His sight: if we be found better than others in good works and humility. Therefore let the Abbot show equal love to all and impose the same discipline on all according to their deserts.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-13may-14sept-13">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 13—May 14—Sept. 13</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>In his teaching the Abbot should always follow the Apostle’s formula: “Reprove, entreat, rebuke”; threatening at one time and coaxing at another as the occasion may require, showing now the stern countenance of a master, now the loving affection of a father. That is to say, it is the undisciplined and restless whom he must reprove rather sharply; it is the obedient, meek and patient whom he must entreat to advance in virtue; while as for the negligent and disdainful, these we charge him to rebuke and correct.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And let him not shut his eyes to the faults of offenders; but, since he has the authority, let him cut out those faults by the roots as soon as they begin to appear, remembering the fate of Heli, the priest of Silo. The well-disposed and those of good understanding let </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-11" title="11"> </span><span>him correct with verbal admonition the first and second time. But bold, hard, proud and disobedient characters he should curb at the very beginning of their ill-doing by stripes and other bodily punishments, knowing that it is written, “The fool is not corrected with words,” and again, “Beat your son with the rod and you will deliver his soul from death.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-14may-15sept-14">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 14—May 15—Sept. 14</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The Abbot should always remember what he is and what he is called, and should know that to whom more is committed, from him more is required. Let him understand also what a difficult and arduous task he has undertaken: ruling souls and adapting himself to a variety of characters. One he must coax, another scold, another persuade, according to each one’s character and understanding. Thus he must adjust and adapt himself to all in such a way that he may not only suffer no loss in the flock committed to his care, but may even rejoice in the increase of a good flock.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-15may-16sept-15">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 15—May 16—Sept. 15</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Above all let him not neglect or undervalue the welfare of the souls committed to him, in a greater concern for fleeting, earthly, perishable things; but let him always bear m mind that he has undertaken the government </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-12" title="12"> </span><span>of souls and that he will have to give an account of them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And if he be tempted to allege a lack of’ earthly means, let him remember what is written: “First seek the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things shall be given you besides.” And again: “Nothing is wanting to those who fear Him.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let him know, then, that he who has undertaken the government of souls must prepare himself to render an account of them. Whatever number of brethren he knows he has under his care, he may be sure beyond doubt that on Judgment Day he will have to give the Lord an account of all these souls, as well as of his own soul.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Thus the constant apprehension about his coming examination as shepherd concerning the sheep entrusted to him, and his anxiety over the account that must be given for others, make him careful of his own record. And while by his admonitions he is helping others to amend, he himself is cleansed of his faults.</span></p>

<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 16—May 17—Sept. 16</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Whenever any important business has to be done in the monastery, let the Abbot call together the whole community and state the matter to be acted upon. Then, having </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-13" title="13"> </span><span>heard the brethren’s advice, let him turn the matter over in his own mind and do what he shall judge to be most expedient. The reason we have said that all should be called for counsel is that the Lord often reveals to the younger what is best.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let the brethren give their advice with all the deference required by humility, and not presume stubbornly to defend their opinions; but let the decision rather depend on the Abbot’s judgment, and all submit to whatever he shall decide for their welfare.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>However, just as it is proper for the disciples to obey their master, so also it is his function to dispose all things with prudence and justice.</span></p>

<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 17—May 18—Sept. 17</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>In all things, therefore, let all follow the Rule as guide, and let no one be so rash as to deviate from it. Let no one in the monastery follow his own heart’s fancy; and let no one presume to contend with his Abbot in an insolent way or even outside of the monastery. But if anyone should presume to do so, let him undergo the discipline of the Rule. At the same time, the Abbot himself should do all things in the fear of God and in observance of the Rule, knowing that beyond a doubt he will have to render an account of all his decisions to God, the most just Judge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" id="page-14" title="14"> </span><span>But if the business to be done in the interests of the monastery be of lesser importance, let him take counsel with the seniors only.

<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 22—May 23—Sept. 22</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The first degree of humility is obedience without delay. This is the virtue of those who hold nothing dearer to them than Christ; who, because of the holy service they have professed, and the fear of hell, and the glory of life everlasting, as soon as anything has been ordered by the Superior, receive it as a divine command and cannot suffer any delay in executing it. Of these the Lord says, “As soon as he heard, he obeyed Me.” And again to teachers He says, “He who hears you, hears Me.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Such as these, therefore, immediately leaving their own affairs and forsaking their own will, dropping the work they were engaged in and leaving it unfinished, with the ready step of obedience follow up with their deeds the voice of him who commands. And so as it were at the same moment the master’s command is given and the disciple’s work is completed, the two things being speedily </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-19" title="19"> </span><span>accomplished together in the swiftness of the fear of God by those who are moved with the desire of attaining life everlasting. That desire is their motive for choosing the narrow way, of which the Lord says, “Narrow is the way that leads to life,” so that, not living according to their own choice nor obeying their own desires and pleasures but walking by another’s judgment and command, they dwell in monasteries and desire to have an Abbot over them. Assuredly such as these are living up to that maxim of the Lord in which He says, “I have come not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”</span></p>

<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 23—May 24—Sept. 23</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>But this very obedience will be acceptable to God and pleasing to men only if what is commanded is done without hesitation, delay, lukewarmness, grumbling, or objection. For the obedience given to Superiors is given to God, since He Himself has said, “He who hears you, hears Me.” And the disciples should offer their obedience with a good will, for “God loves a cheerful giver.” For if the disciple obeys with an ill will and murmurs, not necessarily with his lips but simply in his heart, then even though he fulfil the command yet his work will not be acceptable to God, who sees that his heart is murmuring. And, far from gaining a reward for such </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-20" title="20"> </span><span>work as this, he will incur the punishment due to murmurers, unless he amend and make satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>Therefore, since the spirit of silence is so important, permission to speak should rarely be granted even to perfect disciples, even though it be for good, holy, edifying conversation; for it is written, “In much speaking you will not escape sin,” and in another place, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For speaking and teaching belong to the master; the disciple’s part is to be silent and to listen. And for that reason if anything has to be asked of the Superior, it should be asked with all the humility and submission inspired by reverence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" id="page-21" title="21"> </span><span>But as for coarse jests and idle words or words that move to laughter, these we condemn everywhere with a perpetual ban, and for such conversation we do not permit a disciple to open his mouth.</span></p>

<br /></span><span>On Humility</span></h2>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-25may-26sept-25">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 25—May 26—Sept. 25</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Holy Scripture, brethren, cries out to us, saying, “Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.” In saying this it shows us that all exaltation is a kind of pride, against which the Prophet proves himself to be on guard when he says, “Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are mine eyes lifted up; neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonders above me.” But how has he acted? “Rather have I been of humble mind than exalting myself; as a weaned child on its mother’s breast, so You solace my soul.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Hence, brethren, if we wish to reach the very highest point of humility and to arrive speedily at that heavenly exaltation to which ascent is made through the humility of this present life, we must by our ascending actions erect the ladder Jacob saw in his dream, on which Angels appeared to him descending and ascending. By that descent and ascent we must surely understand nothing else than </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-22" title="22"> </span><span>this, that we descend by self-exaltation and ascend by humility. And the ladder thus set up is our life in the world, which the Lord raises up to heaven if our heart is humbled. For we call our body and soul the sides of the ladder, and into these sides our divine vocation has inserted the different steps of humility and discipline we must climb.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-26may-27sept-26">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 26—May 27—Sept. 26</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The first degree of humility, then, is that a person keep the fear of God before his eyes and beware of ever forgetting it. Let him be ever mindful of all that God has commanded; let his thoughts constantly recur to the hell-fire which will burn for their sins those who despise God, and to the life everlasting which is prepared for those who fear Him. Let him keep himself at every moment from sins and vices, whether of the mind, the tongue, the hands, the feet, or the self-will, and check also the desires of the flesh.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-27may-28sept-27">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 27—May 28—Sept. 27</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Let a man consider that God is always looking at him from heaven, that his actions are everywhere visible to the divine eyes and are constantly being reported to God by the Angels. This is what the Prophet shows us when he represents God as ever present within our thoughts, in the words “Searcher </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-23" title="23"> </span><span>of minds and hearts is God” and again in the words “The Lord knows the thoughts of men.” Again he says, “You have read my thoughts from afar” and “The thoughts of men will confess to You.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In order that he may be careful about his wrongful thoughts, therefore, let the faithful brother say constantly in his heart, “Then shall I be spotless before Him, if I have kept myself from my iniquity.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-28may-29sept-28">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 28—May 29—Sept. 28</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>As for self-will, we are forbidden to do our own will by the Scripture, which says to us, “Turn away from your own will,” and likewise by the prayer in which we ask God that His will be done in us. And rightly are we taught not to do our own will when we take heed to the warning of Scripture: “There are ways which to men seem right, but the ends of them plunge into the depths of hell”; and also when we tremble at what is said of the careless: “They are corrupt and have become abominable in their wills.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And as for the desires of the flesh, let us believe with the Prophet that God is ever present to us, when he says to the Lord, “Every desire of mine is before You.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-29may-30sept-29">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 29—May 30—Sept. 29</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>We must be on our guard, therefore, against evil desires, for death lies close by the gate </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-24" title="24"> </span><span>of pleasure. Hence the Scripture gives this command: “Go not after your concupiscences.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So therefore, since the eyes of the Lord observe the good and the evil and the Lord is always looking down from heaven on the children of men “to see if there be anyone who understands and seeks God,” and since our deeds are daily, day and night, reported to the Lord by the Angels assigned to us, we must constantly beware, brethren, as the Prophet says in the Psalm, lest at any time God see us falling into evil ways and becoming unprofitable; and lest, having spared us for the present because in His kindness He awaits our reformation, He say to us in the future, “These things you did, and I held My peace.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-30may-31sept-30">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 30—May 31—Sept. 30</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The second degree of humility is that a person love not his own will nor take pleasure in satisfying his desires, but model his actions on the saying of the Lord, “I have come not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.” It is written also, “Self-will has its punishment, but constraint wins a crown.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="jan-31june-1oct-1">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Jan. 31—June 1—Oct. 1</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The third degree of humility is that a person for love of God submit himself to his </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-25" title="25"> </span><span>Superior in all obedience, imitating the Lord, of whom the Apostle says, “He became obedient even unto death.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-1june-2oct-2">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 1—June 2—Oct. 2</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The fourth degree of humility is that he hold fast to patience with a silent mind when in this obedience he meets with difficulties and contradictions and even any kind of injustice, enduring all without growing weary or running away. For the Scripture says, “He who perseveres to the end, he it is who shall be saved”; and again, “Let your heart take courage, and wait for the Lord!”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And to show how those who are faithful ought to endure all things, however contrary, for the Lord, the Scripture says in the person of the suffering, “For Your sake we are put to death all the day long; we are considered as sheep marked for slaughter.” Then, secure in their hope of a divine recompense, they go on with joy to declare, “But in all these trials we conquer, through Him who has granted us His love.” Again, in another place the Scripture says, “You have tested us, O God; You have tried us as silver is tried, by fire; You have brought us into a snare; You have laid afflictions on our back.” And to show that we ought to be under a Superior, it goes on to say, “You have set men over our heads.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" id="page-26" title="26"> </span><span>Moreover, by their patience those faithful ones fulfil the Lord’s command in adversities and injuries: when struck on one cheek, they offer the other; when deprived of their tunic, they surrender also their cloak; when forced to go a mile, they go two; with the Apostle Paul they bear with false brethren and bless those who curse them.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-2june-3oct-3">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 2—June 3—Oct. 3</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The fifth degree of humility is that he hide from his Abbot none of the evil thoughts that enter his heart or the sins committed in secret, but that he humbly confess them. The Scripture urges us to this when it says, “Reveal your way to the Lord and hope in Him,” and again, “Confess to the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever.” And the Prophet likewise says, “My offense I have made known to You, and my iniquities I have not covered up. I said: ‘I will declare against myself my iniquities to the Lord;’ and ‘You forgave the wickedness of my heart.’”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-3june-4oct-4">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 3—June 4—Oct. 4</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The sixth degree of humility is that a monk be content with the poorest and worst of everything, and that in every occupation assigned him he consider himself a bad and worthless workman, saying with the Prophet, “I am brought to nothing and I am without </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-27" title="27"> </span><span>understanding; I have become as a beast of burden before You, and I am always with You.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-4june-5oct-5">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 4—June 5—Oct. 5</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The seventh degree of humility is that he consider himself lower and of less account than anyone else, and this not only in verbal protestation but also with the most heartfelt inner conviction, humbling himself and saying with the Prophet, “But I am a worm and no man, the scorn of men and the outcast of the people. After being exalted, I have been humbled and covered with confusion.” And again, “It is good for me that You have humbled me, that I may learn Your commandments.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-5june-6oct-6">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 5—June 6—Oct. 6</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The eighth degree of humility is that a monk do nothing except what is commended by the common Rule of the monastery and the example of the elders.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-6june-7oct-7">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 6—June 7—Oct. 7</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The ninth degree of humility is that a monk restrain his tongue and keep silence, not speaking until he is questioned. For the Scripture shows that “in much speaking there is no escape from sin” and that “the talkative man is not stable on the earth.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-7june-8oct-8">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 7—June 8—Oct. 8</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The tenth degree of humility is that he be </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-28" title="28"> </span><span>not ready and quick to laugh, for it is written, “The fool lifts up his voice in laughter.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-8june-9oct-9">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 8—June 9—Oct. 9</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The eleventh degree of humility is that when a monk speaks he do so gently and without laughter, humbly and seriously, in few and sensible words, and that he be not noisy in his speech. It is written, “A wise man is known by the fewness of his words.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="feb-9june-10oct-10">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Feb. 9—June 10—Oct. 10</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The twelfth degree of humility is that a monk not only have humility in his heart but also by his very appearance make it always manifest to those who see him. That is to say that whether he is at the Work of God, in the oratory, in the monastery, in the garden, on the road, in the fields or anywhere else, and whether sitting, walking or standing, he should always have his head bowed and his eyes toward the ground. Feeling the guilt of his sins at every moment, he should consider himself already present at the dread Judgment and constantly say in his heart what the publican in the Gospel said with his eyes fixed on the earth: “Lord, I am a sinner and not worthy to lift up my eyes to heaven”; and again with the Prophet: “I am bowed down and humbled everywhere.” Having climbed all these steps of humility, therefore, the monk will presently come to </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-29" title="29"> </span><span>that perfect love of God which casts out fear. And all those precepts which formerly he had not observed without fear, he will now begin to keep by reason of that love, without any effort, as though naturally and by habit. No longer will his motive be the fear of hell, but rather the love of Christ, good habit and delight in the virtues which the Lord will deign to show forth by the Holy Spirit in His servant now cleansed from vice and sin.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>The Offices of Terce, Sext and None are to be celebrated in the same order, that is: the “Incline unto my aid, O God,” the hymn proper to each Hour, three Psalms, lesson and verse, “Lord, have mercy on us” and concluding prayers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If the community is a large one, let the Psalms be sung with antiphons; but if small, let them be sung straight through.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let the Psalms of the Vesper Office be limited to four, with antiphons. After these Psalms the lesson is to be recited, then the responsory, the Ambrosian hymn, the verse, the canticle from the Gospel book, the litany, the Lord’s Prayer and the concluding prayers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let Compline be limited to the saying of three Psalms, which are to be said straight through without antiphon, and after them the hymn of that Hour, one lesson, a verse, the “Lord, have mercy on us,” the blessing and the concluding prayers.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Let this verse be said: “Incline unto my aid, O God; O Lord, make haste to help me,” and the “Glory be to the Father”; then the hymn proper to each Hour.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then at Prime on Sunday four sections of Psalm 118 are to be said; and at each of the remaining Hours, that is Terce, Sext and None, three sections of the same Psalm 118.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At Prime on Monday let three Psalms be said, namely Psalms 1, 2 and 6. And so each day at Prime until Sunday let three Psalms be said in numerical order, to Psalm 19, but with Psalms 9 and 17 each divided into two parts. Thus it comes about that the Night Office on Sunday always begins with Psalm 20.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>Psalm 118 having been completed, therefore, on two days, Sunday and Monday, let the nine Psalms from Psalm 119 to Psalm 127 be said at Terce, Sext and None, three at each Hour, beginning with Tuesday. And let these same Psalms be repeated every day until Sunday at the same Hours, while the </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-39" title="39"> </span><span>arrangement of hymns, lessons and verses is kept the same on all days; and thus Prime on Sunday will always begin with Psalm 118.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Vespers are to be sung with four Psalms every day. These shall begin with Psalm 109 and go on to Psalm 147, omitting those which are set apart for other Hours; that is to say that with the exception of Psalms 117 to 127 and Psalms 133 and 142, all the rest of these are to be said at Vespers. And since there are three Psalms too few, let the longer ones of the above number be divided, namely Psalms 138, 143 and 144. But let Psalm 116 because of its brevity be joined to Psalm 115.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The order of the Vesper Psalms being thus settled, let the rest of the Hour—lesson, responsory, hymn, verse and canticle—be carried out as we prescribed above.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" id="page-40" title="40"> </span><span>We strongly recommend, however, that if this distribution of the Psalms is displeasing to anyone, he should arrange them otherwise, in whatever way he considers better, but taking care in any case that the Psalter with its full number of 150 Psalms be chanted every week and begun again every Sunday at the Night Office. For those monks show themselves too lazy in the service to which they are vowed, who chant less than the Psalter with the customary canticles in the course of a week, whereas we read that our holy Fathers strenuously fulfilled that task in a single day. May we, lukewarm that we are, perform it at least in a whole week!</span></p>

Having used applications, the ointments of exhortation, the medicines of the Holy Scriptures, finally the cautery of excommunication and of the strokes of the rod, if he sees that his efforts are of no avail, let him apply a still greater remedy, his own prayers and those of all the brethren, that the Lord, who can do all things, may restore health to the sick brother.</span></p>

And at other times also, if anyone should want to pray by himself, let him go in simply and pray, not in a loud voice but with tears and fervor of heart. He who does not say his prayers in this way, therefore, shall not be permitted to remain in the oratory when the Work of God is ended, lest another be hindered, as we have said.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>As soon as a guest is announced, therefore, let the Superior or the brethren meet him with all charitable service. And first of all let them pray together, and then exchange </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-73" title="73"> </span><span>the kiss of peace. For the kiss of peace should not be offered until after the prayers have been said, on account of the devil’s deceptions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the salutation of all guests, whether arriving or departing, let all humility be shown. Let the head be bowed or the whole body prostrated on the ground in adoration of Christ, who indeed is received in their persons.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the guests have been received and taken to prayer, let the Superior or someone appointed by him sit with them. Let the divine law be read before the guest for his edification, and then let all kindness be shown him. The Superior shall break his fast for the sake of a guest, unless it happens to be a principal fast day which may not be violated. The brethren, however, shall observe the customary fasts. Let the Abbot give the guests water for their hands; and let both Abbot and community wash the feet of all guests. After the washing of the feet let them say this verse: “We have received Your mercy, O God, in the midst of Your temple.”</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the reception of the poor and of pilgrims the greatest care and solicitude should be shown, because it is especially in them that Christ is received; for as far as the rich </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-74" title="74"> </span><span>are concerned, the very fear which they inspire wins respect for them.</span></p>

And on the other hand, when they have less to occupy them, let them go out to whatever work is assigned them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And not only in their case but in all the offices of the monastery let this arrangement be observed, that when help is needed it be supplied, and again when the workers are unoccupied they do whatever they are bidden.</span></p>

For it is sufficient if a monk has two tunics and two cowls, to allow for night wear and for the washing of these garments; more than that is superfluity and should be taken away. Let them return their stockings also and anything else that is old when they receive new ones.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Those who are sent on a journey shall receive drawers from the wardrobe, which they shall wash and restore on their return.

Yet the Abbot should always keep in mind the sentence from the Acts of the Apostles that “distribution was made to each according as anyone had need.” In this manner, therefore, let the Abbot consider the weaknesses of the needy and not the ill-will of the envious. But in all his decisions let him think about the retribution of God.</span></p>

This promise he shall make before God and His Saints, so that if he should ever act otherwise, he may know that he will be condemned by Him whom he mocks. Of this promise of his let him draw up a petition in the name of the Saints whose relics are there and of the Abbot who is present.

<p class="pfirst"><span>In the constituting of an Abbot let this plan always be followed, that the office be conferred on the one who is chosen either by the whole community unanimously in the fear of God or else by a part of the community, however small, if its counsel is more wholesome.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Merit of life and wisdom of doctrine should determine the choice of the one to be constituted, even if he be the last in the order of the community.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But if (which God forbid) the whole community should agree to choose a person who will acquiesce in their vices, and if those vices somehow become known to the Bishop to whose diocese the place belongs, or to the Abbots or the faithful of the vicinity, let them prevent the success of this conspiracy of the wicked, and set a worthy steward over the house of God. They may be sure that they will receive a good reward for this action if they do it with a pure intention and out of zeal for God; as, on the contrary, they will sin if they fail to do it.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Once he has been constituted, let the Abbot always bear in mind what a burden he has undertaken and to whom he will have to give an account of his stewardship, and let him know that his duty is rather to profit his brethren than to preside over them. He must therefore be learned in the divine law, that he may have a treasure of knowledge from which to bring forth new things and old. He must be chaste, sober and merciful. Let him exalt mercy above judgment, that he himself may obtain mercy. He should hate vices; he should love the brethren.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In administering correction he should act prudently and not go to excess, lest in seeking too eagerly to scrape off the rust he break the vessel. Let him keep his own frailty ever before his eyes and remember that the bruised reed must not be broken. By this we do not mean that he should allow vices to grow; on the contrary, as we have already said, he should eradicate them prudently and with charity, in the way which may seem best in each case. Let him study rather to be loved than to be feared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let him not be excitable and worried, nor exacting and headstrong, nor jealous and over-suspicious; for then he is never at rest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" id="page-91" title="91"> </span><span>In his commands let him be prudent and considerate; and whether the work which he enjoins concerns God or the world, let him be discreet and moderate, bearing in mind the discretion of holy Jacob, who said, “If I cause my flocks to be overdriven, they will all die in one day.” Taking this, then, and other examples of discretion, the mother of virtues, let him so temper all things that the strong may have something to strive after, and the weak may not fall back in dismay.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And especially let him keep this Rule in all its details, so that after a good ministry he may hear from the Lord what the good servant heard who gave his fellow-servants wheat in due season: “Indeed, I tell you, he will set him over all his goods.”</span></p>

<br /></span><span>On the Prior of the Monastery</span></h2>
<div class="level-3 section" id="apr-22aug-22dec-22">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Apr. 22—Aug. 22—Dec. 22</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It happens all too often that the constituting of a Prior gives rise to grave scandals in monasteries. For there are some who become inflated with the evil spirit of pride and consider themselves second Abbots. By usurping power they foster scandals and cause dissensions in the community. Especially does this happen in those places where the Prior is constituted by the same Bishop or the same Abbots who constitute the Abbot </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-92" title="92"> </span><span>himself. What an absurd procedure this is can easily be seen; for it gives the Prior an occasion for becoming proud from the very time of his constitution, by putting the thought into his mind that he is freed from the authority of his Abbot: “For,” he will say to himself, “you were constituted by the same persons who constituted the Abbot.” From this source are stirred up envy, quarrels, detraction, rivalry, dissensions and disorders. For while the Abbot and the Prior are at variance, their souls cannot but be endangered by this dissension; and those who are under them, currying favor with one side or the other, go to ruin. The guilt for this dangerous state of affairs rests on the heads of those whose action brought about such disorder.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="apr-23aug-23dec-23">
<h3 class="center level-3 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Apr. 23—Aug. 23—Dec. 23</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>To us, therefore, it seems expedient for the preservation of peace and charity that the Abbot have in his hands the full administration of his monastery. And if possible let all the affairs of the monastery, as we have already arranged, be administered by deans according to the Abbot’s directions. Thus, with the duties being shared by several, no one person will become proud.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But if the circumstances of the place require it, or if the community asks for it with </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-93" title="93"> </span><span>reason and with humility, and the Abbot judges it to be expedient, let the Abbot himself constitute as his Prior whomsoever he shall choose with the counsel of God-fearing brethren.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That Prior, however, shall perform respectfully the duties enjoined on him by his Abbot and do nothing against the Abbot’s will or direction; for the more he is raised above the rest, the more carefully should he observe the precepts of the Rule.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If it should be found that the Prior has serious faults, or that he is deceived by his exaltation and yields to pride, or if he should be proved to be a despiser of the Holy Rule, let him be admonished verbally up to four times. If he fails to amend, let the correction of regular discipline be applied to him. But if even then he does not reform, let him be deposed from the office of Prior and another be appointed in his place who is worthy of it. And if afterwards he is not quiet and obedient in the community, let him even be expelled from the monastery. But the Abbot, for his part, should bear in mind that he will have to render an account to God for all his judgments, lest the flame of envy or jealousy be kindled in his soul.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>At the gate of the monastery let there be placed a wise old man, who knows how to receive and to give a message, and whose maturity will prevent him from straying about. This porter should have a room near the gate, so that those who come may always find someone at hand to attend to their business. And as soon as anyone knocks or a poor man hails him, let him answer “Thanks be to God” or “A blessing!” Then let him attend to them promptly, with all the meekness inspired by the fear of God and with the warmth of charity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Should the porter need help, let him have one of the younger brethren.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If it can be done, the monastery should be so established that all the necessary things, such as water, mill, garden and various workshops, may be within the enclosure, so that there is no necessity for the monks to go about outside of it, since that is not at all profitable for their souls.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>When brethren return from a journey, at the end of each canonical Hour of the Work of God on the day they return, let them lie prostrate on the floor of the oratory and beg the prayers of all on account of any faults that may have surprised them on the road, through the seeing or hearing of something evil, or through idle talk. And let no one presume to tell another whatever he may have seen or heard outside of the monastery, because this causes very great harm. But if anyone presumes to do so, let him undergo the punishment of the Rule. And let him be punished likewise who would presume to leave the enclosure of the monastery and go anywhere or do anything, however small, without an order from the Abbot.</span></p>

But if he sees that the weight of the burden altogether exceeds the limit of his strength, let him submit the reasons for his inability to the one who is over him in a quiet way and at an opportune time, without pride, resistance, or contradiction. And if after these representations the Superior still persists in his decision and command, let the subject know that this is for his good, and let him obey out of love, trusting in the help of God.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>But boys up to 15 years of age shall be carefully controlled and watched by all, yet this too with all moderation and discretion.

Giving priority, therefore, to the commands of the Abbot and of the Superiors appointed by him (to which we allow no private orders to be preferred), for the rest let all the juniors obey their seniors with all charity and solicitude. But if anyone is found contentious, let him be corrected.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And if any brother, for however small a cause, is corrected in any way by the Abbot or by any of his Superiors, or if he faintly perceives that the mind of any Superior is angered or moved against him, however little, let him at once, without delay, prostrate himself on the ground at his feet and lie there making satisfaction until that emotion is quieted with a blessing.

Thus they should anticipate one another in honor; most patiently endure one another’s infirmities, whether of body or of character; vie in paying obedience one to another—no one following what he considers useful for himself, but rather what benefits another—; tender the charity of brotherhood chastely; fear God in love; love their Abbot with a sincere and humble charity; prefer nothing whatever to Christ.

For what page or what utterance of the divinely inspired books of the Old and New Testaments is not a most unerring rule for human life? Or what book of the holy Catholic Fathers does not loudly proclaim how we may </span><span class="pageno target" id="page-100" title="100"> </span><span>come by a straight course to our Creator? Then the Conferences and the Institutes and the Lives of the Fathers, as also the Rule of our holy Father Basil—what else are they but tools of virtue for right-living and obedient monks? But for us who are lazy and ill-living and negligent they are a source of shame and confusion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Whoever you are, therefore, who are hastening to the heavenly homeland, fulfil with the help of Christ this minimum Rule which we have written for beginners; and then at length under God’s protection you will attain to the loftier heights of doctrine and virtue which we have mentioned above.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To

<h4 class="center level-4 no-bold pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h4>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

<p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Corrected </span><em class="italics">editions</em><span> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. </span><em class="italics">Versions</em><span> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
